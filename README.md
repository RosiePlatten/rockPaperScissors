# rockPaperScissors
A Basic rock paper scissors game
Initially i started with a basic game where the user inputs through a prompt box and the program outputs to the console.
Then i went back and added a basic UI for the user to interact with.

From this i have learnt that it is important when writing initial code to think about how additional features could be added in as i ended up having to rewrite a lot of my script code
